## About Me

I am a freelance marketing professional with experience in multiple industries. I work with clients to develop actionable marketing campaigns that convert and drive sales.

In the past three years, I have managed $375k in ad spend for clients, generating $1.5 million total in new revenue.
Freelance work has allowed me to learn multiple industries which allows me to tailor my approach to your business.

"A lot of the marketing industry is based on gut feelings and luck. In a data-driven world, marketing campaigns should be tailored to specific audiences with real data in mind. Marketing decisions need to be data-driven rather than just opinion." - me

If you are looking for a fresh set of eyes and real talent using data-driven marketing, I am both of those things.


## Career Highlights

- $370k spent in ads for $1.5 million in revenue
- 4 million views on TikTok for a client under management
